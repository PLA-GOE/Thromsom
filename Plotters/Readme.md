## Thromsom - Violin- and Boxplot

This tool is part of the github-release for our Paper:

# Making the Invisible Visible: Integrated Visualization and Automated Quantification of Thrombus Deformation During Mechanical Thrombectomy
(Ernst et al., 2026)

For testing purposes and due to githubs size-restraints, we will share a test dataset for each stent-retriever via this link:

[Test-Data and examples](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/l7qJCG250VdI4NJ)

## Prerequisite

Install all requirements from the requirements.txt

## Part 1

To create the Violin- and Boxplots enter the values from your aggregated data.csv-collection. Adjust the labels for the axis and title.

Run the script with

    python3 violin.py
    
or 

    python3 box.py

## Result

The script will output either a violin- or a boxplot depending on which script you choose.

The output of box.py is used in figure 5 in the paper.

The output of violin.py is used in figure 7 and figure 8 in the paper.
